ImageIO reads in data as Image objects. These are standard NumPy arrays with a dictionary of metadata.
Metadata can be quite rich in medical images and can include: 
Patient demographics (name, age, sex, clinical information) and 
Acquisition information (image shape, sampling rates, data type, modality such as X-Ray, CT or MRI).

print(im.meta)

"""
cmap controls the color mappings for each value. The "gray" colormap is common, but many others are available.
vmin and vmax control the color contrast between values. Changing these can reduce the influence of extreme values.
plt.axis('off') removes axis and tick labels from the image.
